# React Test Task
## Contains:

* A working example of a filterable table which you can play around with (look below).
* ES6 - 7 Support with Babel.
* Redux dev tools to help you keep track of the app's state.
* Routing.
* Hot module replacement support so you can change modules or react components without having to reload the browser.
* A webpack production config so you can build the app and make it ready for production.
* Sass support, just import your styles wherever you need them.
* ESlint to keep your js readable.

## Run the service
1. Open a new bash shell
2. ```cd streaming-service```
3. ```npm install``` or ```yarn install```
4. ```npm run start``` or ```yarn start```

## Run the app
1. Open a new bash shell
2. ```cd app```
3. ```npm install``` or ```yarn install```
4. ```npm run start``` or ```yarn start```

Once running, if you want to hide the redux dev monitor: ```CTRL+H``` or move it with ```CTRL+Y```


## Run the tests
1. Open a new bash shell
2. ```cd app```
3. ```npm run test_watch``` or ```yarn test_watch```

## Requirements

We need you to implement a solution to display some price ticker data on the UI in realtime. Price data is available from a locally running service. Any additional visuallisations to indicate how prices have changed would be a plus. Testing is also an important part to this exercise.

There are four parts to this application that need implementing:

1. Testing:
    We need test coverage for any code implemented. Feel free to implement any tests in your choice of framework.
2. Service interaction:
    The interviewer may setup a local streaming service to run on your machine that will publish prices for a given ticker at an interval of 0.5 seconds. We want to be able see these prices rendered on the ui. Optional: interval time can be specified using custom frontend dropdown component by user.
3. Data:
    We need to be able convey the service api results to the UI.
4. UI:
    We need the service results to be rendered on the UI via a component, any additional visual effects to highlight positive or negative changes in the prices would be a bonus.

## Price Serive Usage

**Apple Inc. (AAPL)**
### <http://localhost:4000/#AAPL>

Simply replace **AAPL** in the URL with a **valid ticker symbol**. Price tickers are real-time.

## Example JSON Response from the Price Ticker service

    {
        "ticker": "AAPL",
        "exchange": "NASDAQ",
        "price": "116.60",
        "change": "-0.46",
        "change_percent": "-0.39",
        "last_trade_time": "Oct 21, 4:00PM EDT",
        "dividend": "0.57",
        "yield": "1.96"
    }
